          <p>The color of Vhagar's scales, horns, wings, wing bones, and spinal crest, as well as the color of her flame are not mentioned in the books. However, the artist commissioned for the 2021 A Song of Ice and Fire Calendar, Sam Hogg, asked for clarification from George R. R. Martin's team and was told Vhagar was "bronze with greenish blue highlights and bright green eyes".
            According to Tyrion Lannister, Vhagar was large enough that one could ride a horse down her gullet.It is said that Vhagar's breath was so hot that it could melt a knight's armor and cook him inside.
            By the time of the Dance of the Dragons, Vhagar was the hardened survivor of a hundred battles, had grown almost as large as Balerion, and was the oldest and largest of the dragons in Westeros. Her roar was so powerful that it could shake the very foundations of Storm's End. No living dragon could match her for size or ferocity.
